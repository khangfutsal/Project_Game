# UnityTilemapMask
The mask component. Works the same as SpriteMask, but used for tilemaps. Very easy to use!

### How to use

1. Download the TilemapMask folder
2. Apply the `TilemapMask.cs` script to an object that the Tilemap is on and set the `Mask Cell` field to the `FloorMask.prefab`.
3. Set the Mask Interaction to "Visible Inside Mask" inside all SpriteRenderers of your sprites, which should only appear inside the mask.
4. See the result! :)
